Today is the 87th day since Wuhan announced lockdown, and the 13th day since Wuhan lifted its lockdown.

We are back to work since Feb 17th and now almost everyone returns to work.

Below are the records of what I heard and what I saw:

# What did they say?

One of my friend:
> Come on, look at the crowds on the metro, don't worry, let's just take a BBQ gathering.

One of my collegue:
> Central Book Store was flooded with people on Weekend, I am scared and order a takaway food from Pizzahut without even dringing the water they served.

One waiter in the restaurant:
> It would be great if I can take off the mask.

# What did I see?

1. Almost all the restaurant are open for dining-in now. Last week only takeaway is allowed in MacDonald and there is no table in the dining area except the opening area outside. But today I saw there is one long table there and there is one person eating there.
2. Lots of people didn't cover their noses when wearing masks.
3. Many people took off their masks and ate food while walking among people. 
4. Photos from medias showed lots of people went to senic spots and some of them didn't wear masks.
